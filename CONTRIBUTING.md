# Contributing

We welcome **contributions** and will give **full credit** for your hard work!

Before submitting an issue or pull request, please read and understand our contribution guide to ensure a smooth process for both contributors and maintainers.

## Code of Conduct

This project is open-source, and as such, maintainers give their time freely to build and maintain the code. It is our collective goal to foster a welcoming and productive community.

Please be respectful to the maintainers and other contributors. Disrespectful behavior, including abusive or inappropriate language, will not be tolerated.

When submitting an issue or a pull request, keep the following principles in mind:

- **Respect**: Be considerate in discussions.
- **Constructive Feedback**: If your submission is rejected, take it as an opportunity to improve and learn.
- **Quality**: Ensure your contributions are of high quality and meaningful for the project's growth.

## Viability

Before requesting or submitting a new feature, consider whether it would be beneficial to the broader community. Open-source projects are used by developers with varied needs, so think about how your feature or change might serve a wider user base.

- Is it a common problem for other developers?
- Could it improve the usability or flexibility of the package for more users?

## Issue Reporting

Before filing an issue:

1. **Replicate the Problem**: Verify if the issue is reproducible and not a one-off occurrence.
2. **Check Existing Issues**: Ensure the problem or feature isn't already reported. You can search through open and closed issues.
3. **Look for Existing Pull Requests**: Check if there's already a pull request in progress for the bug or feature you're raising.

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request, make sure you:

1. **Review the Codebase**: Ensure the feature or fix is not already implemented.
2. **Check Existing Pull Requests**: Ensure the feature or fix is not already being worked on by someone else.
3. **Follow Code Style**: Stick to the project's coding conventions. This includes:

    - **TypeScript Best Practices**: Ensure your code follows TypeScript standards and patterns.
    - **ESLint/Prettier**: Code should be formatted according to our linting and formatting configurations. Use Prettier and ESLint to automatically format your code.

4. **Add Tests**: We require that new features or bug fixes come with tests. Make sure to add unit tests and integration tests, where applicable.
5. **Update Documentation**: If your pull request introduces changes to the behavior of the package, ensure that the README.md and any relevant documentation are updated.
6. **Use SemVer**: Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) guidelines. For major changes that break compatibility, increment the major version number. For minor improvements, increment the minor version, and for bug fixes, increment the patch version.

### Procedure for Submitting a Pull Request:

- **One feature per pull request**: If you're working on multiple features or fixes, please submit separate pull requests for each.
- **Coherent commit history**: Ensure each commit is meaningful. If you need to make multiple changes during development, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
- **Follow the testing strategy**: Ensure that your code passes the unit tests and doesn't break existing functionality.

## Requirements

- **Code Style**: Follow the project's TypeScript code style and standards.
- **Tests**: Your pull request won't be accepted unless it includes tests. Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing.
- **Update Documentation**: Changes in functionality should always be reflected in the documentation.
- **Follow SemVer**: Ensure compatibility with the versioning scheme [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/).
- **Atomic Pull Requests**: One feature or fix per pull request to keep the contributions clear and manageable.

**Thank you for contributing!**

We appreciate your time and efforts in helping improve the project. If you need assistance, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out via issues or direct communication with maintainers.

**Happy coding!**
